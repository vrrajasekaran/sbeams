Notes for BioLink data entry/maintenance: 
- More important or preferable entity will usually be termed 1
- The lesser will be 2 

To enter a new relationship: 
- Determine your evidence_source_id
- Determine your relationship_type_id
- Determine the biosequence_set_id for 1 { and its rank }
- Determine the biosequence_set_id for 2 { and its rank }
- Know name for 1
- Know name for 2

- Does biosequence 1 exist?
  - If so, get biosequence_id 1
  - If not, INSERT it and get biosequence_id 1 

- Does biosequence 2 exist?
  - If so, get biosequence_id 2
  - If not, INSERT it and get biosequence_id 2 

- Does a relationship of this type between these two exist?

  - If yes, is there one from the current evidence_source_id? 

    - If yes, touch the record with today's date. done. 
    - If no, add a line of evidence as additional support. done. 

  - If no, this is a new relationship.
    Is this a canonical name relationship?

    - If yes, does entity 1 already have a canonical name?

      - If yes, is it itself?

        - If yes, then we're okay 
        - If no, we have a bit of a problem here.  Does the previous
          item 1 have a higher rank than the current 1? 

          - If yes, just remap the current item 1 to the previous 
          - If no, we have a serious problem to clean up. The existing
            item 1 needs perhaps to be stripped of canonical status and
            the new one enthroned. This is a tricky process.
            Perhaps break the tie via biosequence_set sort_order.
            Skip for now. 

      - If no, then make entity 1 have a self-referring canonical
        relationship 

    - If no, proceed
    - Regardless, add the relationship and then line of evidence. done.
