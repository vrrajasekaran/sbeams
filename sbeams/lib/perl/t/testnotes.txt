A few notes about SBEAMS tests:

All tests are organized by:
 - Core (automated tests that require no modules to run)
 - Modulename (requires only that module plus Core plus BioLink)
 - other (miscellaneous tests that are only to be used by hand)

All .t tests can be run on a production system without disturbing anything

All .full tests should be run on a test installation with known test
data in it.

Misc thoughts:
- Maybe it would be useful to perform some tests within a transaction
  which is rolled back at the end

It would be nice to get to a state where we could set up a devTT instance,
run all automated tests nightly via cron, and email the results to developers.
