Goals of the design:

- build a basic, flexible user interface and RDBMS interface code on which
  we can build LIMS, analysis tools, and basic data management tools

- Initially used at ISB for:
  - Sequencing LIMS
  - Microarray LIMS + data processing pipeline

- Expandable by design for subsequent use:
  - Microarray analysis interface
  - Proteomics LIMS + data processing
  - Proteomics analysis interface
  -

- Does not appear to be anything similar in the public domain.
  - Design to be an exportable Open Source Project



Requirements:


- Similar interface from all platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.)
  - Java GUI
  - Web Interface tools:
    - Perl CGI (any CGI programs easily integratable)
    - PHP
    - mod_perl
    - Java servlets
    - Java applets

- Command line/interactive/programmatic interface
  - Perl
  - ROOT

- Interchangeable RDBMS back ends
  - Perl DBI
  - Java JDBC / ODBC

- easy to extend and add
  - for novice programmers?
