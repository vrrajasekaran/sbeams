## This document illustrates the creation of a branch within subversion (svn),
## and the subsequent merging of that file back into the trunk

# A branch is simply an svn copy operation.  We store branches in
# /sbeams/sbeams/branches relative to svnroot.  Here we provide a source and
# destination for the copy command, as well as a comment.
svn copy file:///net/dblocal/svn/sbeams/sbeams/trunk/sbeams file:///net/dblocal/svn/sbeams/sbeams/branches/devDC -m "Creating a dev branch to allow glycopeptide commits without disrupting Unipep"

# Once a branch is created, you can check it out normally by specifying the
# appropriate path
svn co file:///net/dblocal/svn/sbeams/sbeams/branches/devDC sbeams_svn_devDC

# In order to use if for sbeams development, you can symlink it to a directory
# called sbeams
ln -s sbeams_svn_devDC/ sbeams

# In this case we are checking out a clean version of the trunk
svn co file:///net/dblocal/svn/sbeams/sbeams/trunk/sbeams sbeams_svn_pure

# Assuming we've made changes to a file in the branch repository, this code will
# merge those changes back to the trunk we've just checked out (branch rev at
# 5053, trunk version at 5050)
svn merge -r 5050:5053 file:///net/dblocal/svn/sbeams/sbeams/branches/devDC/lib/perl/SBEAMS/Connection/ .

# We can check the status, and check in the changes if satisfied.
svn status
svn info
svn ci Settings.pm -m 'Merging revisions from devDC branch 4982:4984'
