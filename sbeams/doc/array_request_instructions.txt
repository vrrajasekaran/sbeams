- Verify that your Project (including budget, etc.) is up to date:
  - Click "Projects" on left navigation bar
  - Click on your Project # or "Add Project"


- Create the request for a set of microarrays:
  - Click "Array Requests" on left navigation bar
  - Click "Add Array Request" option
  - Fill in appropriate fields
  - If your Project is not listed, add your Project as described above
  - After filling in number of slides and samples per slide, click REFRESH
  - Fill in the data table
    - Use unique names for all different samples, but use the same name for
      different tubes containing the same sample (e.g. the control)
    - When possible, place control (ratio denominator) in second column
      at least for the first repeat
  - Click REFRESH
  - Verify all information you have typed in to be sure it is all correct
  - If you make any adjustments, click REFRESH

  - When everything is correct, click INSERT to submit your request

  - If your submission was claimed to be successful, click on the PRINTABLE
    VIEW.  It would probably be a good idea to print out the submission for
    your own records, although it will remain in the database.

  - If you are giving sample tubes to the Array Group for labeling, please
    mark the tubes with the Sample IDs that were assigned by the database.


- To check on the status of your request:
  - Click "Project Status" on left navigation bar
  - Select your project from the option box and press QUERY
