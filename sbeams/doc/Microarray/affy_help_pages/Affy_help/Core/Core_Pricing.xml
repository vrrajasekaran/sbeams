			<description>* These prices are for internal users only. External users must negotiate prices with Affymetrix directly and purchase these items themselves. Please note that labeling kits components each contain the EXACT volume necessary for 30 reactions, so after allowing for pipetting errors it is unlikely you will actually be able to label 30 RNAs from a single labeling kit.</description>
