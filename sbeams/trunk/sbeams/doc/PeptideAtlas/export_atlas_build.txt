## Exporting PeptideAtlas builds ##

  This document describes the process of creating an Atlas build export as an 
SBEAMS XML document as well as a mysql dump file.  Currently only one build 
can be exported at a time, and it is not known if multiple builds created in
this manner can be loaded into the same database.

# Step 1: Create SBEAMS table XML export of atlas build 
run the export_atlas_build.pl script with the build_id as the lone argument,
the following example will export build 100:

$SBEAMS/lib/scripts/PeptideAtlas/export_atlas_build.pl -b 100

This will create a file in /tmp named atlas_build_100.xml.  This file is 
suitable for loading into a blank database schema

# Step 2 (optional): In order to create a mysql dump file, you must first load
the exported data into a blank mysql database.  The following shows the various
steps involved, you may skip any that don't apply to your situation (or modify
based on your knowledge of mysql).   For these steps I've assumed a mysql user
named sbeams already exists, and that an appropriate sbeams dev instance has 
been created that points at the mysql instance (see below).


  # Example SQL to create database to store schema
--DROP DATABASE peptide_atlas_test
  CREATE DATABASE peptide_atlas_test;
  USE peptide_atlas_test;
  GRANT ALL ON peptide_atlas_test to 'sbeams'@'%';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  COMMIT WORK;

  # Set configuration file in an appropriate dev instance to point at the newly
  created mysql database.  Specifically, the following settings should provide 
  the correct values:
( assuming dbname is peptide_atlas_test).

DB_DATABASE     = peptide_atlas_test
DBPREFIX{BioLink}     = peptide_atlas_test.
DBPREFIX{Core}     = peptide_atlas_test.
DBPREFIX{PeptideAtlas}     = peptide_atlas_test.
DBPREFIX{Proteomics}    = peptide_atlas_test.
DB_DATABASE     = human_all
DB_DATABASE     = microarray_schema
DB_DATABASE     = peptide_atlas_test
DB_DATABASE     = sbeams

DB_DRIVER   = DBI:mysql:$DB_DATABASE:$DB_SERVER
DB_PASS     = 52616e646f6d4956d624d072686135e105297f9bbee218f1
DB_SERVER   = dbhost.mydomain.org
DB_TYPE     = MySQL
DB_USER     = sbeams

  # You must also edit the Core_POPULATE.sql file to specify the contact and
  user_login information for the uid the scripts are run as (yours!).  This is
  necessary because we are using SBEAMS functions and authentication.

  # Build necessary schema elements.  Due to the inclusion of a single foreign
  key reference, it is necessary to load the proteomics module as well.  In 
  order to run the script you must first set DBNAME and SBEAMS environent
  variables, and edit script to 

  $SBEAMS/lib/scripts/Core/peptide_atlas_schema.sh build

  # Load exported xml into new schema with DataImport.pl.  This is generally
  the longest step by a wide margin, so example runs with nohup, to avoid a
  premature termination of the process, as well as to capture the output.

  nohup DataImport.pl -n -u 0.7 -s /tmp/atlas_build_100.xml &
  
  # Export database as a mysql dump file.  Note that you will be prompted for
  a password if invoked as written, you can optionally provide the password on
  the command line.

  mysqldump -uroot -p peptide_atlas_test > /tmp/atlas_build_100.mysql
  
  # In order to load the exported mysql dump into a blank database, you simply 
  redirect it into the mysql program as shown below.  See password note in
  previous (export) section.

  mysql -u sbeams -p -h dbhost -D peptide_atlas_test_two < atlas_build_100.mysql
