Things to remember for setup.

At ISB the data produced by these scripts is not kept local to the web server.

So the web user needs permission to write to the remote drives.

Have IT setup a new group affydata

Add the web user to this group.

setup the folder "delivery" and change the group to affydata

Need to set group id on the delivery folder so all data written into the folder 
will have the group arraydata
/net/arrays/Affymetrix/core/data_analysis/delivery  chmod g+s


To run the job on pbs you might need to create a new user to run the jobs

We create a user arraybot and added it to the affydata group.

Need to setup a key less ssh connection to the pbs server so the apache cgi
script can hand off the job to the batch schedular
